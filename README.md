# Arkham Horror LCG Tabbed Dividers

This repo is a generator for tabbed dividers for Arkham Horror LCG.  
Check out the generated output [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JPricey/arkham_tabbed_dividers/blob/main/tabbed_dividers.html)! Or see notes below on how to customize the output yourself.

This output is intended to be printed on 8.5x11.

## Code Layout

`card_definitions.py` contains the definition for all dividers. Each divider can customize its colour, icon, text, and watermark set icon. Divider sets can set a custom tab width.  
`dividers.py` contains the code for turning a divider definition into a rendered divider.  
`main.py` is the main entry point to the script. It's also where we choose which dividers should be included in final outputs.  
`tabbed_dividers.html` is the final output of the script. Open this page up in your browser, and print it out!

## Generating

Make sure you have python 3 installed. Install dependencies and run the script to generate a new tabbed_dividers.html:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py
```

Select which cards you want generated by commenting out the options in main.py.

## TODOs

This project is not complete. The following sets are missing:

- [ ] The Labyrinths of Lunacy (have icons, just need to make dividers)
- [ ] The Blob That Ate Everything Else (have icons, just need to make dividers)
- [ ] Unofficial Return to Innsmouth

I'm not currently working on completing this project, however if you would like to take this on I will happily give help / guidance.
